# AppHiLives
HiLives is a European project that emerged under the scope of the curricular unit of Project, with the purpose of creating a Web application that can connect young people with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD) to Universities and Companies. This is because it is a target audience that has difficulty in inclusion, so, through the application is promoting the inclusion of these young people, facilitating contact and their insertion in these two environments.

This application is something pilot, developed only for Portugal, serving for final graduation project purposes, as well as for the identification of requirements, problems and tests with possible users, being that its development at European level will come later. Thus, the website was developed using HTML 5, CSS 3, JavaScript, JQuery, Ajax, PHP and MySQL. Furthermore, being an audience with special needs, it was necessary to implement accessibility measures, complemented with the Userway plugin.
